    <h2>My Journey to Software Engineering</h2>
    <p>I entered my undergrad experience at UCLA in 2017 as a psycho-biology major.</p>
    <h2>What I Want to Accomplish</h2>
    <p>In this coding bootcamp, I want to learn full-stack web development and really develop my interests as I progress
        in my journey of becoming a software engineer.</p>
    <h2>Personal Hobbies</h2>
    <p>In my free time, I like going to the gym as well as trying new things with my friends. Most recently, I have
        rock-climbing (hard-stuck at the v2-3 level, though.)</p>
